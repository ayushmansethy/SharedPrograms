Certainly! Here's a simple example of a relational database schema for the scenario you described:

Customers Table:

Represents information about each customer.
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(50),
    customer_email VARCHAR(50),
    customer_address VARCHAR(255)
);
Orders Table:

Represents information about each order.
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);
Items Table:

Represents information about each item in an order.
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Items (
    item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    item_name VARCHAR(50),
    item_price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    quantity INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id)
);
ShippingAddresses Table:

Represents information about shipping addresses.
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE ShippingAddresses (
    address_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    address_line1 VARCHAR(255),
    address_line2 VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(50),
    state VARCHAR(50),
    zip_code VARCHAR(20),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);
In this schema:

The Customers table contains information about each customer, such as their name, email, and address.
The Orders table represents each order with details like the order ID, the customer ID (foreign key), and the order date.
The Items table contains information about each item in an order, such as the item name, price, and quantity. It also has a foreign key reference to the Orders table.
The ShippingAddresses table stores shipping address details, including the customer ID (foreign key), address lines, city, state, and zip code.
This is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you might need to consider additional details, normalization, and optimizations based on specific requirements and constraints.
